To get started on adding custom deploy rules, check out the [default examples](Plugin/dist/rules).
| action | usage |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `base` | set variable `params[0]` with value `params[1]` |
| `copy` | copy `params[0]` to `params[1]` |
| `copy_if` | do `copy` if file exists |
| `package` | add `params[0..-1]` list of sources to zip file `params[-1]` |
| `remove` | remove `params` list of sources |
| `script` | execute raw powershell script |

The following base variables are provided by default:

```
cmake_output    // this is the binary output path
dist            // this is the dist folder path, also the working directory of deployer script
project_name    // project name same as CMakeLists
project_version // project version same as CMakeLists
```

Deploy actions can be enabled by build configuration(`debug`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo`, etc)
